# Code-Lines
A simple formatter for turning code segments to blocks with numbered lines

This code ignores &lt;code&gt;inline code&lt;/code&gt; and only applies formatting to text wrapped in &lt;pre&gt; with nested &lt;code&gt; blocks. . This skeleton example makes use of [Document.html](https://github.com/cypnk/Document.html), but you can use your own styling. The JavaScript is self-contained.

A demonstration of a single line of formatted code:

And a mult-line code block using the same JavaScript that renders this functionality:
